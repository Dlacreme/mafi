# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
mafi-back/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
mafi-back/log/*
mafi-back/tmp/*
!mafi-back/log/.keep
!mafi-back/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
mafi-back/tmp/pids/*
!mafi-back/tmp/pids/
!mafi-back/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
mafi-back/storage/*
!mafi-back/storage/.keep
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
mafi-back/config/master.key
mafi-back/vendor
